            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>I am a senior research officer at <a href=https://www.essex.ac.uk/>the University of Essex</a> and <a href="https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship/associate-fellowship">Advance Higher Education Associate</a> Fellow, where I work alongside <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/LONGY19108/Yunfei-Long">Dr. Yunfei Long</a> on " Improving multimodality misinformation detection with affective analysis " project funding by Alan Turing Insititute. </p>
            <p>Before starting this role, I was doing  my part-time PhD under the supervision of <a href="https://www.zubiaga.org/"> Dr. Arkaitz Zubiaga</a>, worked as a part-time Teaching Fellow at <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/">Queen Mary University of London</a>. And received <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/former-enrichment-students/peiling-yi"> Enrichment Scheme Placement award (in-person)</a> in Alan Turing Institute. Record of high-quality research output in relevant conferences and journals in computational social science and NLP, such as ICWSM, World Wide Web and Online Social Networks and Media (2024 best survey paper). I was also a full-time mother of two teenagers and trained as rock climber instructor. It was where I developed strong time management skills and learned how to navigate unexpected chaos.</p>
            <p>Before moving into academia, I spent ten years in the corporate world as a Software Engineer and Product Manager, working with some of the world’s leading companies. I gained experience in building solutions, solving problems, and surviving endless meetings (mostly without losing my sanity). Today, I combine that real-world experience with my research, blending practicality and curiosity to take on new challenges.</p>

            <h2>Research interests</h2>

            <p> My research interests focus on developing innovative deep transfer learning and fair machine learning algorithms to mitigate online harm, such as cyberbullying, disinformation, and misinformation. I am particularly passionate about creating  unbiased and transparent AI solutions that enhance  responsible  decision-making in online social platforms. My work involves exploring robust techniques to detect and prevent harmful content while maintaining fairness, interpretability, and adaptability across diverse social media platforms. </p>
